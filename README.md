# lazpaint-upstream
Repository containing all files necessary to build LazPaint.

To create the Debian package, retrieve the content of the repository in a subdirectory inside a directory dedicated to upstreams. Rename the directory as lazpaint-### where ###Â is the version number. Compress this folder into a file in the upstream directory in tar.gz format and rename it to lazpaint-###.orig.tar.gaz. Then from the subdirectory, run the following commands:
- apt install build-essential devscripts debhelper
- debuild -us -uc

To make the binary without creating a package, first call configure then call make. On Linux the syntax is:
- ./configure
- make

This will produce the binary in the folder /lazpaint/release
